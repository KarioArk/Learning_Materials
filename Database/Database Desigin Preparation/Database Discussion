What happens when a query happens in DB?
 - Query execution plan
Database Optimizations
- Query Optimizations
 - Query execution plan
- Index - Key value pair - Database go and will look in key value pair and if there are no database, it will do a full table search
 - Keep Index - default column(id)
 - Reads are faster, writes are slower
 - Hint
 - More number of Index, will slow down the data inserts, reads, updates because index also getting updated
 - If it is Nonsequential, then it will be difficult to inserts, reads or updates - Better to have sequential as Index
- Scaling
 - IO - scale vertically
- Partitioning
 - Table Partitition - Example VIN Partition - Take last 2 digits and combination will be less, data will be partitioned and kept
 - Database Partitition
- Sharding

Database Monitoring
Database Shards
Zookeeper will take care of sharing across shards
