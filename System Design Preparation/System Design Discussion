System Design  - Using GCP

Use case - 
	Book store search - we need to get the list of books based on Popularity

TRIE
Least Recently Used (LRU) is a common caching strategy.

What to be done?
Parts of System Design

CDR - ??

System Design Layer
- Frontend -> GCS, NGINX, Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE), Cloud Run, Google App Engine - Learn about Frontend Patterns, MicroFE, Headless Architecture, SSR, Modular Feduration to achieve MicroFrontEnd
- BE -> Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE), Cloud Run, Google App Engine
- DB - It should be ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)  

SQL and No SQL - (Search about NewSQL - looks like Couchbase is NewSQL)

SQL
- OLTP - Online transaction processing (OLTP) captures, stores, and processes data from transactions in real time.

Example: 

	MySQL
	Oracle
	PostgreSQL
	Microsoft SQL Server
	MariaDB
	IBM Db2
	Amazon Aurora
	Google Cloud Spanner

- OLAP - Online analytical processing (OLAP) uses complex queries to analyze aggregated historical data from OLTP systems.

Example: 

	Teradata
	BigQuery
	AWS Redshift

- ETL - the force that joins OLTP and OLAP - The data from one or more OLTP databases is ingested into OLAP systems through a 				process called extract, transform, load (ETL). 
		
		With an ETL tool, users can collect data from several sources and send it to a destination, such as an OLAP data warehouse, where it is queried by analytics and business intelligence tools for insights.


- Scaling - Load Balancer - Don't think too much about scaling at first - Generally don't scale any layers
